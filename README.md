CREATING A NEW GAME
    to create a game, select 'create a new game' in the start menu. a new window will show up. 
    in that window you can select the options for the shuffling. then, you will need to select
    the game path and the modified game path. the game path is the folder where baba is you.exe
    located. the modified path is an empty folder where a new exe will appear. the paths that
    you selected will automatically appear in future uses. note: creating a new modified game
    in a folder of an already generated modified game will overwrite it.
    then, go to the modified game file and run the exe. enjoy.

    clicking on 'create a game with last settings' will instantly start generating a new
    game with the last settings and last shuffling options. if any error appears, please create
    a new game normally and fix the problem.
